## Proposal

The growing volume of data in used car auctions provides a significant opportunity to analyze and predict vehicle pricing trends. This research aims to leverage the publicly available dataset from Kaggle, titled "Used Car Auction Prices," to analyze auction prices and identify factors influencing vehicle valuation. Employing statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the project will study the relationships between different indicators of cars to explore the underlying factors affecting auction prices and provide data analysis support for subsequent price prediction efforts.

The **Used Car Auction Prices** dataset, curated by Kaggle user **tunguz**, serves as a comprehensive resource for analyzing pricing trends in the used car auction market. It is particularly relevant for researchers, data scientists, and practitioners in the fields of automotive research, economics, and machine learning.

### Overview and Structure

This dataset provides extensive information on used cars sold at auctions, including key attributes such as make, model, manufacturing year, mileage, and additional specifications. It also includes the final auction price, which can be used as a target variable for predictive modeling tasks.

### Key Attributes

- **Vehicle Characteristics**  
  Details such as the make, model, manufacturing year, and mileage, which are essential for understanding pricing mechanisms and depreciation trends.

- **Auction Details**  
  Contextual information regarding auction platforms and sale conditions, providing insights into transactional data.

- **Price Information**  
  The selling price at auctions, which is the primary focus of the dataset and can be used for trend analysis and predictive modeling.
